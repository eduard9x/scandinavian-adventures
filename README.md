# AKQA-coding-test

## Web developer coding test

### Instructions

The purpose of this test is to assess how you might approach a typical Web
Developer task. We have left this open-ended and would like to see your
methods and which tools you feel most comfortable with.

Please treat the test as a greenfield project - keep it simple and have fun
with it, spending as little or as much time as you need to demonstrate your
abilities. We would like to see how you approach the problem and it doesn’t
necessarily need to be a complete solution. We are looking for quality over speed.

Please have thoughts about how you would handle device compatibility,
accessibility and how this may influence the structure of your code. How can
you ensure quality is built in? How would you ensure the solution works? We
may ask you about these aspects of your solution.

### The Task

We have provided some creative assets for a simple travel booking website
and would like you to build this as a responsive site. To keep things simple
keep any state in-memory or in the browser. The creative assets and product
data are available in the following locations:

* Designs - Web Developer Exercise
* Static PNG’s: 
* Json Product Data: https://webdev-exercise.netlify.app/data/products.json

Note: You will need to create a free account with Figma in order to see the
top link, but this tool will allow you to easily retrieve measurements between
selected elements by holding the alt key. You can export assets by selecting
the layer you need and clicking EXPORT + in the bottom right panel. Enable
comments in the top nav to see additional design notes.

- Please use whichever tools or frameworks you are comfortable with and
    think are appropriate for the task. There is no right or wrong answer.
- Focus only on modern browsers such as the latest Google Chrome/
    Firefox. The solution should also work on modern mobile devices.
- The fonts are available from Google fonts as a free download, and/or inclusion
    into your project. (Fahkwang Semibold and Muli Regular/Bold/Black)
